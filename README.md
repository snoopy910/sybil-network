This project is to create a zk-rollup for proof-of-uniqueness. This is a system where users can register an Ethereum address in a Sybil resistant way, i.e. one person can’t register many Ethereum addresses. This register can be used for many things such as doing an airdrop that can’t be cheated and even things like voting systems. With this register, users can also do things like make a proof that they own an Ethereum address that is on the register without revealing which one, which allows things like private voting.
